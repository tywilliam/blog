Very few software developers have a good grasp on the essence of software development. They aren't aware of the most important tools at our disposal or how to put them to good use

| We write code with more bugs and make it harder for others developers to understand. And the effects are costly. We spend more time maintaining software than we do creating it from scratch, and our bugs impact billions of peopls all over the world. The entire world runs on software today. Every new car is a mini supercomputer on wheels, and problems with software design cause real accidents and cost real human lives.

The process of software development is breaking down large problems into smaller problems. Building components that solve those smaller problems, then composing those components together to form an application.
Likewise, everytime you chain methods, lodash methods, observables, your composing functions. If your chaining, your composing. If your passing return values into other functions.

The solution is to have extendable, scalable and reusable components, An alternative approach is to use high-order functions and composition.

| const g = n => n + 1
| const f = n => n * 2;
`
    const doStuff = x => {
        const afterG = g(x);
        const afterF = f(afterG);
        return afterF;
    };
    doStuff(20); // 42
`
