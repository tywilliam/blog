## Avoid Password Composition Rules



### Rules for password handling.



1. ONLY Enforce a minmum unicode password length (min 8-10) 

2. Check against common passwords ("password12345") 

3. Check for basic entropy ( don't allow "aadada" )

4. Don't use password composing rules (at least one "!@#$%")

5. Don't use password hints (rhymes with "assword")

6. Don't use knowledge-based authentication ('security' questions)

7. Don't expire passwords without reason.

8. Don't use SMS for two-factor authentication

9. Use a password salt of 32-bits.
