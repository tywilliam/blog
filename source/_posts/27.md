OK, If you need a little understanding to why you want to use Redux. This post is for you. Redux I think refactors how to code front-end in half.

With Redux, 
-   You can manage front-end state externally and internally and create complex inheritances and permission systems. 

-   You can create applications to run on any scale in a predictable model. 

-   You can always check on your code and see what needs to be changed, what's changed and what to add easily. Since the code is built for that.

-   Your learning an in-demand language and are on board.

Redux is just the first step, there are many tools and libraries that goes with Redux to extend it's abilities for you to implement.
