#### Backward Compatibility

A property of a system, product or technology that allows for interoperability with an older legacy system or with input designed for such system. sometimes called downward compatibility. A complimentary concept is forward compatibility. A design that is forward compatible usually has a roadmap for compatibility for future products and standards.
