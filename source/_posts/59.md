## Partial Application

Partial application is a technique of fixing a number of arguments to a function, prducing another function of smaller arguments (i.e. binding values to one or more of those arguments as the cain of function progressed)



~~~javascript

function add1(x) {
  return 1 + x;
}
~~~



~~~
function addition(x,y) {
  return x + y;
}
~~~



~~~
const plus5 = addition.bind(null,5)
plus5(10)
//output: 15
~~~



JavaScript has the built-in method ( .bind ) that works on functions with any number of arguments and can bind on arbitrary amount of parameters. 

~~~
.bind(thisValue, [arg1], [arg2])

~~~

It turns functions into a new function whose implicit this parameter is this value and whose initial arguments are always given this value does not matter for the (non-method) function addition which is why it is null.

## Summary

Partial application produces functions of arbitrary number of arguments. The transformed. function is different from the original - it needs less arguments. 



Advantages:

- Easier reuse of more abstract functions which leads to clean code and less complexity which improves code expressive power and maintainability.
