## Spectacle

This software runs on any unix machine. I needed to layout my windows when programming multi tasking to see my app on one side and editor on one side with your keyboard only!



## Google Chrome
I use this software a lot when browsing the web or running app servers. I needed an easier way to use it than clicking everywhere on my screen. so I memorized the hotkeys

Cmd + T 
for new tab

Cmd + N 
for new window

Cmd + L
to select the url

Ctrl + Tab
to switch tabs

Cmd + B 
for bookmarks

Cmd + D
save page in bookmark

this has speeded up my browser use!
