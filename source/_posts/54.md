It's helpful to know the history of databases to have a full-rounded view of its purpose and reason / past usage. DB is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality. In a way that supports processes requiring information. Such as modeling the availabilit of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vaccancies.

### Databases store trillions of user data all over the world 

## Relational Databases

    Provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries users directly state what info they want from it.

IBM pressured to do, charged developers and isolated them from Codd's own Alpha Language but created a non-relational one, SEQUEL so superior it was copied! Could you! <b>Larry Ellison (wedding photographed by Steve Jobs) of Relational Software Inc in his Orcale Database reached market before SQL/DS Codd started a revolution he lead it competition pointed to him something others built upon over years</b>
