People tend to imitate what they see but if they 
can't see it they can't imitate it. The key then to making ideas spread is to make them more public.


Design products so that they advertise themselves. This is why baristas seed up jars, and why students in MBA programs eventually all want to go to investment banking or consulting -- social influence magnifies initially.

What's cool is that üï∂Ô∏è behvaior is public and thoguhts are private.

## How to make the abstract private products cause more public?

Examples: 
-   No shave november is a men's cancer awareness campaign.

- Create products that advertise themselves. E.g. sent from my iPhone.

- Use distinctive characteristics like shapes, sounds,etc to help products advertise themselves.

- Behavioral residue: Physical traces of actions like the "I voted for" sticker or Lulemon bags ( indicate that you have voted, have shopped at Lululemon ) giveaways.
