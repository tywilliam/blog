A benefit is something we use to increase our performance as a creative. Social media with the constant overhead of notifications and the randomness of events seems radically chaotic and unstable. To be a creative you need to be solid and run over long periods of time without a shake. Your goal is what you need to focus on and the performance it takes to get there. As trends come and go, you need to be on your two feet. People will hop on the next trend and you will be in your apartment watching it go past.

A distraction is something that you perceive as a distraction that coomes into interference with your performance as a creative and must be stopped and killed immediately before it ruins your spiritual chakras. 

You can't be both a developer social media guru and a part-time photographer and workspace snapshotter. No you can't. You have to master one thing. Elon Musk is not a part time photographer. If you need one, hire one. Freelancing and part-time instagramming?  Are you serious? This is not beneficial in fact it only messes you up..

C
hoose because Instagram/social media requires a lot of attention and energy from you to master. If you need social media benefits then hire a specialist to do it. If you need any other assistance outside of your main passion of work, hire someone to do it. Passive incomes? Hire someone else. You will thank yourself later.
