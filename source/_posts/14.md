Coding, I know it's about 3,000 people in SE Asia right now coding from home with a 600 bucks a month budget. And traveling with a secure backpack. Honestly that's what I'm aiming for. 

Imagine being able to build whatever you want and deploy it to the world from whatever location you want. Location-independence.  Having whatever setup you want and sharing your thoughts and creative experiences online through Medium and other exports. Recording content on for YouTube or Instagram. 

Taking care of health is important in these situations. I suggest people buy a tooth-filling kit online. So cavities you can heal it yourself. Also keep herbal remedies. And eat shiitake mushrooms and take care of your colon. And be careful when you decide to do physical-motor things such as swimming in deep oceans, sky diving, climbing high buildings and doing dangerous things that can cause you to get hurt and pay extensive medical fees. In the US medical and dental care is primairly expensive.
