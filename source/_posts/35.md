## Test Coverage
Tests are a good thing but they are not always affordable and make sense for the project. 

Writing modules, micro services which will not be treated for at least one month.

- When writing open source code
- Writing code toucjing financial channels.
- When you have resources for updating tests at the same time as code was updated.

* When you don't need tests: 
    - When you are a startup
    - When you have small team
        and code changing is fast.
    - When you write scripts that can be simply tested.


## Comments

Comments showing bad code,
good code should only be understandable without a line of comments But what to do to save time for new developers? Write simply ubkube dicynebtatuib describing what and how methods work,
This will save much time for understanding even more -- it will give people more chances to come up better implementation of this method. Good start for code documentation.
