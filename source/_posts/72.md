## 7 Stages of of Action In Design

Clicking a button, scrolling, sign up, pin, trash, collect. Actions!



Cognitive thoughts lead to emotions; emotion drive cognitive thoughts. The brain is structured to act upon the world, and <ul>every action carries with it expectations, and these expectations drive emotions</ul>

The emotional system is a powerful information processing system that works in tandem with cognition. 

Cognition attempts to make sense of the world: emotion assigns value. Cognition provides understanding: emotion provides value to judgements. 



A human without a working emotional system has difficulty making choices.

A human without a cognitive system is dysfunctional.



#### The Visceral Level

The visceral system allows us to respond quickly and subconciously without concious awareness of control.

(Instant notifications, instant access no awareness of control , response quicness is priority, emergencies, flashes, extremism, unaffected by context or history)

- Minimizes its ability to learn.
- Responds to the immediate present and produces an affective state, relatively unaffected by context or history.
- Tightly coupled to the body's musculature - the motor system. This is what causes us to fight or flee, or to relax.

For the tech designers, the visceral response is about immediate perception. This has nothing to do with how usable, effective or understandable the product is. It is all about attraction and repulsion. 



#### The Behavioral Level

The behavioral level is the home of learned skills triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns. ( aware of open door, response is too quick (unlock & enter we learned how to open a door ) for concious control. Behavior takes control triggered by the well-learned action)



- Actions and analyses at this level are highly subconscious.
- We aware of our actions, unaware of details. Our responses occur for too quickly for concious control. It is the behavior level that takes control.
- When we perform a well-learned action, think of goal and the behavioral level handles details the concious mind bus little or no awareness beyond creating the desire to act. ( openening your phone, previous page, new todo item)

The most critical aspect of the behavioral level is that every action is associated with an expectation. Information in the feedback loop of evaluation confirms or disconfirms the expectations resulting in three (3) results:

1. satisfaction (fulfillment of one's wishes, expectations, or needs, or the pleasure derived from this.)
2. relief (a feeling of reassurance and relaxation following release from anxiety or distress.)
3.  disappointment ( sadness or displeasure caused by the nonfulfillment of one's hopes or expectations. )



##### Feedback is critical to managing expectations, and good design provides this. â€” is how expectations are resolved and is critical to learning and the development of skilled behavior. expectation ===  resolved ? Unresolved :



#### The Reflective Level

The refelective level is the home of concious cognition where reasoning and concious decision-making take place. The visceral and behavioral levels are subconscious and, as a result, respond quickly but without much analysis. Reflection is cognitive deep and slow. It often occurs after the events have happend
