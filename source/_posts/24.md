Many technology companies wants to change you, programmer. 

As a programmer we must focus on:

1. Bettering o`ur skillset.
2. Document our knowledge on a blog.
3. Read books
4. Contribute to open-source
5. More sticker swag
6. Developer slack channels

Because 
I feel joy after seeing my console.log's.
 I feel joy after my mongoDB instance is running. I feel joy after seeing my CSS animations appear on page. I feel joy seeing my editor load.
  I feel joy seeing my page load speeds. 
  I love that. It's my life.
There's no create youtube video , or take a photo of my desk setup in my work flow! What the log!

But there is a finding a font for my code editor, a boilerplate for my next project or a markdown documentation template! That's for resolved promise!
