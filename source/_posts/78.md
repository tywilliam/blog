Execution in javascript is weirdly sophisticated , once mastered you can build projects without brain fog or searching the web for an answer that was in the manual!

- single threaded 
- global context
- Infinite functions
- synchronous

Execution context as the term for the current environment/scope the current code is in.

Function contexts each function call creates a new context, which creates a private scope.



Interpreter in a browser is implemented as a single thread. 1 thing can ever happen in what is called an Execution stack.



### Every call to an interpreter

1. Creation stage

   - Create the scope chain.

   - Create variables, functions and arguments.
   - Determiine the value of 'this'.



2. Activation/Code 
   - Execution stage assigns values, references to functions and interpret / execute code.



`~

​	(function foo(i) {

​		if(i === 3) {
​            return
​        } else {
​            foo(i++)
​        }
​	}(0))

`

~

Each time foo() is called a new execution context is created.

 Once done, it pops off the stack and others until global context is created/reached.
