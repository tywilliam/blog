# Learning is my #1 Hobby. 



Learning is on my schedule. There is never a shortage of information and knowledge.


Unlimited online resources and courses, an abundundant job prospectives learning something new is never enough for me,, it may be a hindrance. There are forever tactics, abilities and maneuvers to learn about business history, software, software patterns. (What are the errors made when making JavaScript, what problems where the most common, etc). Learning how to think logically, using mathematical quotations to explain things. There are many professionals who specialize in specific areas of domain. Which I find interesting to come upon their work and read what they've done and documented. The quality of their expertise in that subject is always a eyebrow raiser. I haven't mastered specific areas which I want to invest in is the mathematics needed for the 21st century. 

Topics such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Eigendecomposition of a matrix, LU Decomposition, QR Decomposition/Factorization, Symmetric Matrices, Orthogonalization & Orthonormalization, Matrix Operations, Projections, Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors, Vector Spaces and Norms are needed for understanding the optimization methods used for machine learning.

Probability Theory and Statistics (Combinatorics, Probability Rules & Axioms, Bayesâ€™ Theorem, Random Variables, Variance and Expectation, Conditional and Joint Distributions, Standard Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial, Uniform and Gaussian), Moment Generating Functions, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Prior and Posterior, Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP) and Sampling Methods.)
The traditional classroom is dying because of the vast amount of resources available on the internet. 

Multivariate Calculus: Some of the necessary topics include Differential and Integral Calculus, Partial Derivatives, Vector-Values Functions, Directional Gradient, Hessian, Jacobian, Laplacian and Lagragian Distribution.

Llearn a lot about business history from reading business books 10 years ago and seeing the patterns, learning different ways to profit of software. Reading about the secret failures, closings and dramatic scenes in technology were eye-opening,
