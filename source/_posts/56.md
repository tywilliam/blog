 There's paradigms for everything but once I came across paradigms for Redux it changed everything ðŸ˜Ž
## Component State
State that exists inside of a single component, In React, think state updated with setState()

## Relative State
    State passed from a parent to a child.
    In React, think props passed as properties
    "on" a child component. 
A lot of state belongs in the view, as it reflects
the UI. <b>But what about all the other code that reflects your underlying data and logic.</b>


## Provided State, my favorite kind of steak, 
    State held in a root provider, and accessed by a consumer somewhere
    down the component tree, regardless of "proximity". In React, think of the context API.


Putting everything inside of views can lead to a poor seperation of concerns it ties you to a JavaScript view library, it makes code harder to test? and perhaps the greatest annoyance. It becomes complicated by the fact that designs change and it's often hard to tell which components will need which state. The most straightforward choice is to just provide all of the state from the root component, at which point you're probably better off just going with next option.

## External State 
    State can be moved
    outside of the view library. The library can then 'connect'
    using the provider/consumer pattern to keep in sync.

In Redux, you can't directly modify the state. There is only one way in: dispatch an action into the pipeline that eventually updates the state. 

Redux as a global object with pre/post update hooks and a simplified way of "reducing" next state. 

Two sets of listeners along the application pipeline: middleware & subscriptions. Middleware are functions that can listen to actions passed in, enabling tools such as a logger, devtools or a sync with server listener.

<b>Essentially Redux allows us to build React app as you are but delegate all the State and Actions to Redux, With redux we can isolate store having state so all components can talk to it get required state object from it. It's a well known pattern for years and it's a conjugated form to make Redux</b>

Another treat 

## Higher Order Components (HOCs)
    A function that takes an input component and returns an enhanced/modified version of that component.
    :) You will find HOCSs under different names, think of them as decorators.
    Redux connect function is a HOC - "takes" your component and adds a bunch of props to it.
    `
        const withProps = (newProps) => ( WrappedComponent ) => 
        {
            const ModifiedComponent = (ownProps) => (
                <WrappedComponent {...ownProps} {...newProps} />
            );
            return ModifiedComponent;
        };
        
    `
