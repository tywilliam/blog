Pragmatic Programmer is something to pick up after you had a error on your code and need to take some time to think, bring your morality back as a developer, bringing programmer thought models and standards back. Instead of going for a walk. Read this book. It has time-less methods of approaching problems, ways to think about software products and re-affirms the identity of a programmer. One of my favorite is the use cases model where they said when building a software product think of a success case and a error case. It's a humorous read when you open it you want to keep going and it welcomes you to browser through the page, the pages are designed as window tabs
## Membership Economy

Wanna know the success models behind Amazon Prime? Youtube Red? Netflix? Gym Memberships? Loyalty Programs?  We wan't access to it. A gym? We dont want to own it, we want access. Remote communities, access! Amazon Prime, access!
 Nextflix, access not ownership. This book brings about ways to build a membership with your customers like airplane companies have loyalty programs. Give access to content, a utility , a product by monthly or yearly payment. This makes your customers stay and retain revenue. Instead of one-time paying and leaving your members/customers wil pay you over and over for access to your delightful content. Internet is making us more seperate but memberships bring us together. "Oh you have Amazon Prime too?" "You have a costco card?" " You have LA Fitness Gym membership?" "Dropbox Pro?" "YouTube Red? or Blue?" Invision every service as being a membership product. Windows is expected to switch to a service rather than a system.
