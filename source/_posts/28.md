<!-- I want this blog to successfully:
    - Motivate people to honor their choice of being a programmer.
    - To feel a deeper longer meaning to programming.
    - To remove the feeling of fame, photography and media
        and bring revolutionary history facts.
    - To motivate people to build their next project
        with a deeper meaning to coding.

## What Can You Build?

What Can You Build?

That's right. It's your duty as a software developer to build the modern day software, the cutting edge, the new and improved. It's a spare hat for you to put on. 

Software makes people's lives easier by making things more accessible. Computer software since the dawn of time a are a collection of instructions that tell the computer how to work. Now we're programming the software that runs on the software. we're programming the software that runs on http connections and requests. 

Realizing that you have power. Power to create powerful software with your hands to be used by millions and millions of hands on this planet. Since Each of us encounter the same problems and have the same body parts every day, we all see the same sun and moon every day. Nobody is greater or less than eachother, Software is the timeless intangible form of operating value that solves human problems for decades and to be maintained by future constructors. 

This is a perspective to take on personal dignity. Not in a professional, hollywood or music or media sense.

Programming involves only your finger, your operating system and your computer. Solve a problem and code it. Imagine being known for developing several systems on your portfolio that millions of individuals come to use each year. And you maintain the systems and working on several more in your utter time. You will be remembered.

Software is powerful and I feel nor greater nor lesser than the next human being. I feel I have traded a chunk of my time for a chunk of knowledge for building software. I honor, I dedicate my life to software programming.
