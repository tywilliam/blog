I've been really lazy and down with energy for the past couple of days. I can't seem to code like I used too and have little excitemenent to do any projects. I dont feel well mentally and think I need to break for a couple of days or even a week and just relax, watch movies and eat. Right now, I'm feeling I want to only do computer work with my life and I feel completely worn, exhausted and tired and I just want to put work down and sleep. Sorry for not posting for the next couple of days I'll try to chill and hopefully an idea will arise, the light will shine and i'll get my energy back.
