 It's refreshing and clarifying as a developer to go deep into concepts of something. If I need a shift of perception maybe I need to study what perception is again. If I'm trying to build a Navigation bar with search maybe understand what is a navigation bar and search input in the first place and the benefits of having them

## Deep understanding of code
I had some time and I studied into the foundations of UX/UI more. I wanted to know specifically how do designers think about making products. To steal some knowledge, I came out with a big loot. I learned about Limbic Resonance with UI and how colors effect our emotions and reactive animations, User Generated Content, Rounded buttons vs sharp edges , white spaces, fonts. I even got into learning API Design best practices. I want to understand more of designing a web product than just downloading a boilerplate. I wanted to see from a new pair of eyes to make products that retain uses. I got into Member subscriptions and how to create funnel channels and nurture users to stay.
I will continue to learn more about users, products and them both.
