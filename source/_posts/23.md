Some programmers don't hone on their craft for long. It's like they have switch cases in their mind and wibble onto learn other languages.

Mastery is fun. It's fun when you poke around and find tutorials on your main language features that's not widely documented about in that language.

It makes you a better programmer, a thinker and problem solver. You know how to think about problems and how your language interprets your code. This makes you a powerful coding wizard. Knowing different coding styles, different enum types, error handling, famous patterns. This knowledge makes you a legend. You become a wisdom man.
