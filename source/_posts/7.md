 Virtual DOM is a pretty nice invention. It maps your Data Model to your View Model. It chooses what changes need to be made. It maps your data model to the DOM Rendering. It generates how your DOM should look like and the virtual DOM maps this to the real DOM. Thus, real DOM manipulations are done. One node changed? When a node changed from A to B, this one DOM node has to change. Then the virtual DOM does real manipulation to you, for you. It's way faster by comparison than fetching a DOM node. Making comparison to see if we do manipulation or not. In your next application, when writing in React, take on this pattern.
