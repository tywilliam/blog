### How to feel good about your work
You must   believe in your work. There are over 100 people telling you what to believe everyday through media and I'm saying this to motivate you to see the light. It takes courage to publish something when nobody's looking. It takes courage to deploy, post, ship. but you must.

Keep creating in abundance you must keep shipping relentlessly, the faster you go, the quicker the traction will come. 

You must create. I know there's the health side of thinking of how you spend your time till you die. This blog post does not include that. It includes inspiring you to focus on working on that product with 80% of your time in a day. (24 hours) right?

Eventually all those accumulating pieces will reach a tipping point or not. But would you want to stop in a middle of your progress and think hm I should stop now and just start maintaining the work and shipping optionally.

You must overcome the unease you feel in the face of a challenge. You must deploy with your story, your voice.
