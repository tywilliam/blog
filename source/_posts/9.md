Most of the programmer and developer marketing that's out now is focused on Bootcamps, being the next zucks, the developer lifestyle. This is not the truth obviously this is not how the internet works or marketing works. 

The world wide web is made using a HTTP protocol and messaged are transmitted between nodes across the world. Websites are intangible dots of information. It's intangible. It's on  the infinite vast internet universe There are thick huge cables in servers providing access to data for us online. On top of that are ad servers, analytics, tracking, security, vpns

Web development is a fun gooey term. Its classy yet interconnected data environment that we program intangible asset resources. Looking at programming from a ancient perspective of earlier starters.

Physically, the internet is a conjugated network of wires on servers that connect to other servers.

On the flipside, One can see to UI/UX animations, interactions and designs but what those really are intangible assets on 1 node in a million billion internet network. Some call this the "view layer", the "webpage" the "front-end". It is a resource accessed by a server protocol that we've designed using standardized languages and techniques in browsers. We design resources on this one node on a billionth network that is viewable by others via browser which is on mobile and desktop devices.

The internet is an important transformation in how we live, work and investing. Prices are rising I guess so, there are things being built everyday and things are moving fast. In the age of internet the developer is the small, intricate creator in his box. 

## If this changed your perspective on web development and made you look at things in a minimal, intangible funneled box-up way as it did for me, send me an e-mail.
