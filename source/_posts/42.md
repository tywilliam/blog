I found some cool ways to study new topics easily.

Wanna learn product design? Search it on Medium. There's probably several subcultures and articles from that topic. Bookmark them.

Wanna learn about a book but it's sold out on Amazon?
    Search Medium for that particular book summary. 
    Study the entire book.
