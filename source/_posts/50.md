Extreme excitment for the next decade since subscriptions has taken off and web developers in China are developing stuff fast. Bitcoin is skyrocketing and there's more than enough ways to buy and storage your bitcoin virtually and physically too. I store my passwords on a physical drive. A physical drive, a key, a fingerprinter, a digital wallet, a ding dong. It's a eye-opening, futuristic thing to store something digitally valuable physically. I like feeling my information is secure from hackers, it's one priority to have in this century. 
The question over your cup and table could say the security of your facebook, twitter accounts.

Extreme excitement for the digitalitizement of shopping and markets and the chores adding up for digital developers to build the products we use today. An army of developers are developing right now.
