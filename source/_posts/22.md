My todo list is just minimally filled with projects I want to finish to add to  my delicious portfolio package.

A social media app.

A file manager.

A accounting app.

A scheduler.

I launched my file-manager. Called CandyFiles
https://candyfiles.co 
It's own domain, I know, cool right?

It's going to be really exciting to LAUNCH and serve live for people to send GET requests to my app servers.

I want to be remembered as just the developer who serially creates things. Serial killers constantly kills people?!?!? Serial creators constantly creates things and there's a following of people who watch what I create and use it. And when something new of mines, RELEASES, PEOPLE ARE ON IT. They can copy ME, BUY MY SERVICES OFFERED ON THE APP OR share with friends. My small contribution to the world where I create web apps.
Easily and my ideas I can publish. It will get simple but I have to challenge myself to...  THROW UP!

And I can't wait for.. Hackathons, meetups? Yeah? check out my portfolio. 
Next thing you know the word is in the developer community
"Oh yeah, Tyrese, he's good. He built a file upload / download from scratch. And it saves my files when I re login!"
"Yeah, he made lattes.social, and it works after 2 months!"
All which both shows my technical skills and abilities to whichever employer. I know some who worked on several apps larger than these like Movie finder apps similar to Netflix But I'm setting a small goal for myself that I enjoy. Plus this blog is really good for posting ideas about my professional desires in one piece.
Fuck I just can't wait to go nomadic, like seriously
