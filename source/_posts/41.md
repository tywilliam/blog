I own smartphone devices and computer devices.
Smartphone devices require direct finger input via a touch LED screen. 
It can't recognize who you are and give talk to you emphatetically.
Sometimes it won't even know you touched the screen. You can leeve your phone on the table for years and if nothing touches the screen it won't do any calculations.

I have to enter my lock key or use my finger to unlock my device. This is another correlation that our devices need us as much as we need them.

So instead of confusion about why some computer calculations take longer than they supposed to is to remove your expectation from the device. Remove your expectations of proper working from the device and place your attention on giving it direct input.

Direct input to the device so it's software can do it's calculations. Do not expect reward, expect your input to be received not recognized.

Typing letters on the computer. I use to expect it to be recognized and the software to execute properly.

Typing letters on the computer I expect it to be received. I expect the input to be recieved to the computer and whether it receives an error or success is not my concern. error or success is the message back from the calculation. It's telling it has been recognized. It changed the way I think about using my computer to do execute tasks.
