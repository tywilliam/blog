Exercise in between your work breaks help for writing code. Don't write code if you don't feel well or are tired. Work when your in a good mood and feeling happy. I exercise for 25 minutes every day. I recently got a FitBit Flex 2. It tracks your footstep, miles, calorie intake. Pretty cool. I'd love to wear this each day. 

I've been playing with GraphQL and React. I really like building things with React it makes the front-end development process really enjoyable. I've watched various animated side-bar or side menu navigation css tutorials. Coding CSS animations and seeing the result, after coding several html and css projects, I see it's really into a few things. 1. Defining layout & positioning / centering. 2. Coloring, font, shapes and transformations. 3.Animation and Interaction. CSS is a boatload of instructions to set up a website.
