## 0021 | Progress
Today I done about 5 web design projects and 2 react.js projects. I feel more confident about composing react components and passing functions down as props, encapsulation.  Having a child component change the state of a parent component or having a child component execute a parent's method on some input state from the outside world.
https://github.com/tywilliam/multi_step_form_react.git
https://github.com/tywilliam/node_sequelize.git

Both projects refreshed me and satisfied my fix for problem solving.

 I also learned about box-shadow in CSS and alignment properties using calc() function. I hope to continue these web design challenges till I become confident to code up my own sites from scratch. I've built registration forms, several of them and transitions and animations I studied and every concept of Javascript I know by heart from closures, iifes and es8 babel. 

I even worked with APIs and ORMs for several databases. CRUD operations are like second hand knowledge now. I'm still pumped about launching lattes.social. A social network for coffee lovers. Even that domain sounds good. It feels good just typing it in the Browser. 

It feels good knowing I can create a web app with models and infrastructure and design from scratch using basic functionality of mongodb and file uploading. It takes time; Start from a boilerplate, implement those interfaces and payments and launch that bad boy!

I put in a lot of work I think I need a slight break to think and feel good. I'm feeling really satisfied with my progress and how I got so far.
Socializing. Is a good human factor to consider. We need to be influenced by other creatives like ourselves because it's important to relate with others who share the same frequency. It is important to share our thoughts with people of the same thought pattern. These people of the same thought pattern help us feel love and happy in ourselves. 

Even though in the most tragicically amibitious and unforgiving situations, you may want to seclude yourself and focus on your craft. I understand. It's important to do that as now with many blog posts writing saying we should not party in our 20's. You should hone your craft. In percentages, you really cannot have both of the same pie. Honing your craft is a lonely process. If you want a happy caring life, go with the flow of friends and socializations at parties. It is way less complicated than sitting and working on your craft 24/7. 

You can work yourself into darkness and delusionment . It's good to take for a walk at times to de-stress.

Ass developers, we're constantly in our heads working. We need to work but enjoy it and pleasure ourselves. It's important to feel pleasure. You don't want to be robbed of your pleasure from work. Never lose your vision from working. 


I am frightened to speak to people
