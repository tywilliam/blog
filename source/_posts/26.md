Hey to anyone reading this,this blog is entering 2019 and have good posts ahead!

The hours has passed and I've been smelling work all season.

My christmas waas enjoyable and I enjoyed the snow while it's here with family. My time was on Reactjs and Node.js. I couldn't sleep this entire season I moved my set up downstairs by the window to code. 

I've loved working with Reactjs since it's the new thing and GraphQL. I plan to use these technologies extensively in 2019 to develop my next web projects.
