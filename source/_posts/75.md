We believe that people want something new and more. But we forget that there are so many applications on the market that demand our time.

 Each of them has different interactions and we need to learn each one of them.



We have a temptation to reinvent the wheel.

 The industry rarely rewards or offers awards and praises for designing something that has best use of conventions (a way in which something is usually done, especially within a particular area or activity.).

You have to understand the value (time, effort, knowledge ) that went into what you are trying to disrupt and innovate.

For most people, <b>it is not essential to know or understand how your product works. Not because they are not intelligent, but merely because they do not care.</b>
People don't care how your product works. People do not care to understand your product.
So once they nail down the use of your product, they willl rarely switch to something else. Don't make people think.
