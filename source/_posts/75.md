We believe that people want something new and more. But we forget that there are so many applications on the market that demand our time.

 Each of them has different interactions and we need to learn each one of them.



We have a temptation to reinvent the wheel.

 The industry rarely rewards or offers awards and praises for designing something that has best use of conventions (a way in which something is usually done, especially within a particular area or activity.).

You have to understand the value (time, effort, knowledge ) that went into what you are trying to disrupt and innovate. 



## Product instructions must die

Our job is to make stuff clear and obvious. If not obvious than at least self-explanatory. Main thing about instructions is nobody is going to read them. Aim for removing the instructions to make everything self-explanatory. 

<b>But when they are necessary, cut as much as possible.</b> 



### We don't care about how your product works.

For most people, <b>it is not essential to know or understand how your product works. Not because they are not intelligent, but merely because they do not care.</b>
People don't care how your product works. People do not care to understand your product.
So once they nail down the use of your product, they willl rarely switch to something else. Don't make people think.

  They do not make you think about why it is not working. You don't even notice they have new technology. A person knows <b>whenever you open the case near your device, it is going to connect</b>. It is that easy.

## People don't look for "subtle cues" - we are in a hurry.



My favorite , we designers, <b>love giving the users subtle effects and adding beautiful delights. Right? Your users don't care about it? No matter how much they tell you they do. How much do I have to see this until it's enough?

<b>Life is a much more demanding and stressful environment than an app's delights & subtle effects. In a busy moment, people will not give a f* about your subtle cues. Use them not when it kills user flow.</b>

## We allow personal feeling to take over the process.



You ask the wrong questions. It is not productive to ask questions like "Do people like dropdown menus?" The <b>right question to ask</b> is "Does this drop-down menu with these words in this context on this page create a good experience for people who are likely to use this site?"

#### You ask the wrong questions.

- Leave aside "do people feel like it? " and get deeper into the strategy in the context of the design.
- If we focus on what people like we will lose focus on energy. Usability testing will erase any likes and show what needs to be done.

#### When a user/person uses your product , you forget that he/she shouldn't spend time thinking about.

- Where am I? 
- Where should I begin?
- Where the f* did they put ____?
- Why did they call it that way?
- Is that an ad or part of the site?

Every question that pops into our head, when using our product, only adds up to cognitive workload. It distracts our attention from "why I am here?" and "what I need to do?" And for rule, people don't enjoy solving puzzles when they merely want to know if that button is clickable or not.

And every time you make a user tap on something that does not work or it looks like a button/link. But it's not, also adds to pile of question because who built it did not care.
