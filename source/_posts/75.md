### Don't re-invent the wheel.



<u> But we forget that there are so many applications on the market that demand our time.</u>

The "industry" rarely rewards or offers awards and praises for designing something that has best use of conventions (a way in which something is usually done, especially within a particular area or activity.).

 Understanding the value (time, effort, knowledge ) that went into the disruption and innovation. 



## Product instructions must die

The main thing about instructions is nobody is going to read them. Make stuff clear and obvious. <b>Aim for removing the instructions to make everything self-explanatory.</b> 

<b>But when they are necessary, cut as much as possible.</b> 



### We don't care about how your product works.

For most people, <b>it is not essential to know or understand how your product works. Not because they are not intelligent, but merely because they do not care.</b>
People don't care how your product works. People do not care to understand your product.
So once they nail down the use of your product, they willl rarely switch to something else. Don't make people think.

  They do not make you think about why it is not working. You don't even notice they have new technology. A person knows <b>whenever you open the case near your device, it is going to connect</b>. It is that easy.

## People don't look for "subtle cues" - we are in a hurry.



My favorite , we designers, <b>love giving the users subtle effects and adding beautiful delights. Right? Your users don't care about it? No matter how much they tell you they do. How much do I have to see this until it's enough?

<b>Life is a much more demanding and stressful environment than an app's delights & subtle effects. In a busy moment, people will not give a f* about your subtle cues. Use them not when it kills user flow.</b>

## We allow personal feeling to take over the process.



You ask the wrong questions. It is not productive to ask questions like "Do people like dropdown menus?" The <b>right question to ask</b> is "Does this drop-down menu with these words in this context on this page create a good experience for people who are likely to use this site?"

#### You ask the wrong questions.

- Leave aside "do people feel like it? " and get deeper into the strategy in the context of the design.
- If we focus on what people like we will lose focus on energy. Usability testing will erase any likes and show what needs to be done.

#### When a user/person uses your product , you forget that he/she shouldn't spend time thinking about.

- Where am I? 
- Where should I begin?
- Where the f* did they put ____?
- Why did they call it that way?
- Is that an ad or part of the site?

Every question that pops into our head, when using our product, only adds up to cognitive workload. It distracts our attention from "why I am here?" and "what I need to do?" And for rule, people don't enjoy solving puzzles when they merely want to know if that button is clickable or not.

And every time you make a user tap on something that does not work or it looks like a button/link. But it's not, also adds to pile of question because who built it did not care.

Building universal applications can be tedious because you have to do a lot of configuration on both the server side and client side.

This is the problem Nuxt.js aims to solve for Vue applications. Nuxt.js makes it simple to share code between the client and the server so you can focus on your application’s logic.

Nuxt.js gives you access to properties like isServer and isClient on your components so you can easily decide if you’re rendering something on the client or on the server. 

Lastly, Nuxt gives you access to an asyncData method inside of your components you can use to fetch data and render it on the server side.

The biggest innovation of Nuxt comes with its nuxt generate command. This command generates a completely static version of your website. It will generate HTML for every one of your routes and put it inside of its own file.
 There’s markup there to make loading the page faster and to help search engine and social media crawlers crawl the website.

The difference is that you don’t need a server anymore. Everything gets generated during the development phase.

For each route (page) that is statically generated, the route gets its own JavaScript file too, with just the code that’s needed to run that route.

This can really help with speed because it keeps the size of the JavaScript file small relative to your entire application’s size.

Nuxt.js provides a starter template called starter-template that gives you all the scaffolding that you need to get started with a project with a good folder structure for organization.

### To sum it all up

All of these features make the development of Vue.js apps a much nicer experience. Even if you don’t need a universal app and want to stick with an SPA, there are still benefits to using Nuxt.js. It can be your project’s main base with benefits like .vue files, ES6 compilation, and many more features.
### Get great project structure by default
In many small Vue applications you end up managing the structure of the code as best as you can in multiple files. The default Nuxt.js application structure gives you a great starting point for organizing your application in an understandable way.
