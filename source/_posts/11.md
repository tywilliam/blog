# Flexbox:
Wait, you can come up with a layout No frameworks No Bootstrap? I'm dissapointed I haven't learned this yet. Raw CSS barebones from the ground up! After studying it and understanding it's differences to Grid which is another display type.

Flexbox is for content you have on your page that you want to dynamically change size, order or how near or further you want them, which direction you want them in, how you want them aligned vertically and horizontally.
Flexbox is mainly used for sections in a web page. Not creating an entire layout. Use Flexbox in a Navbar, a header. 

If your going to create an entire layout in two dimensions -- with both rows and columns -- then use CSS Grid.


# Content vs layout
Flexbox takes basis in content while Grid takes basis in the layout. Might seem abstract. So let's look at a specific example as that makes it easier to understand.


`
        <header>
            <div>Home</div>
            <div>Search</div>
            <div>Logout</div>
        </header>
`
Before we turned it into a Flexbox layout these div's would have been on top of eachother

However, when we git it a `display:flex;` the items will be placed nicely in a line.

To move the logout button far right side, simply target the element and give it a margin
`margin-left: auto;`


## Grid
We can create our header in several different ways using CSS Grid. I'm going to go with a pretty straight-forward one, where our grid has ten columns each being one fraction unit wide.

`
    header {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 1fr);
    }
`

It'll look identical to the Flexbox Solution

However, we can peak under the hood to see what's different. We'll use the Chrome Inspector to inspect the column lines:

The key difference with this approach is that we had to define the columns -- the layout first. We start with defining the width of the columns, and then we place the content in the available grid cells.

This approach forced us to take a stance on how many columns we wanted to split our header into.

Unless we change the grid, we're stuck with ten columns. A limitation we wouldn't have had to deal with in Flexbox.

In order to change the logout to the far right hand side, we'll place it in the tenth column, like this:
