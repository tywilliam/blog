__90% of security problems in your next project can be avoided if the following principles are followed_!



1. Secure the weakest link: security is a chain. 
2. Practice defense in-depth: manage with diverse defensive strategies.
3. Failures are unavoidable and should be planned for.
4. Least privilege: **minimum access ** required to perform an operation and only for the minimum time necessary.
5. Minimize the amount of potential damage by organizing the system into the smallest number of units as possible.
6. Promote Privacy.
7. Hiding secrets is inherently difficult.
8. Be reluctant to trust: Servers shall be designed to distrust clients and conversely.
9. Use your community resources: use security libraries and crypto-graphic.

#### Look at the project from an adversity perspective!

#### Design with the enemy in mind!



Often unapplied because system admins tend to not make changes on a system that "looks" overworked. 

Often software is developed in an "internet time" highly compressed schedule in order to be first to market. ( Approach considers it an add-on ) after delivery when vulnerabilites are found, frequently as a result of an attack, patches are developed and issued to the community a form of penetrate and patch approach to security.

- Developers only patch problems which they know about. Find and never report to developers.
- Patches are rushed out as a result of market pressures.
- Often fix the symptom not and introduces new problems of the underlying process. Their own to a system.
